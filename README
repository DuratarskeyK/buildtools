This script will build general buildtools for a 64 bit elf target. It will compile:

binutils (ld, bfd, gas)
gmp
mpfr
gcc (gcc, g++)
newlib

USAGE:

To use this, add OS specific hooks to newlib, edit build.sh line 1 and give the name of the os target, and run

./build.sh

This will build the tools in the 'local' directory.

FEATURES:

1. Will compile a complete C and C++ toolchain.

PREREQUISITES:

The gcc tools require m4, autoconf, automake and texinfo (or another source of makeinfo) to successfully compile.

BUGS:

1. Does not compile fortran target.
